# Kindergarten discord bot
A discord bot that allows your users to temporarily lock each other in a dedicated channel c:

Use the `/set-kindergarten` command to set up a kindergarten channel in your server
and follow the instructions it will send you. After that, your users will be able to use
the `/lock-user` command to lock each other there.

Due to how the permission system of discord works, this bot needs the "manage channels" and "manage roles"
permission on the whole server to set everything up and deny kindergartened users access to other channels.
